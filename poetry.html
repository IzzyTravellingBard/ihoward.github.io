		<h3> Saint Patrick/Damballah </h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="column">
				<p> You once stood on the mantle<br>
				Perfumed by the bitter chocolate of peat<br>
				Master of a low-lying house<br><br>
				Your frame sext against deltas cast in stone<br>
				Wooden beads, wooden beams<br><br>
				Your chipped paint eyes keen<br>
				Caught every hem curling around the door<br>
				The curve of a plucking hand<br><br>
				Your cheeks flushed in the vigour of it all<br>
				The rutting of the floorboards<br>
				Their creaks and withers<br>
				Giving to the intimacy of naked feet<br>
				Recoiling at the drop of a bottle<br><br>
				Your image distorted in the shattered glass </p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p>Now, behold yourself<br>
				Peppered with acrid spice<br>
				Warped by heat and water<br><br>
				Having lured the New World<br>
				Teeming with wild spirits<br><br>
				You do not delight in evil<br>
				Evil is not the painted mask of death<br>
				Nor the convulsing white-eyed priest<br><br>
				You who banished the serpents<br>
				Have but coaxed them out again<br>
				To coil in your untamed beard<br>
				And against your leathery skin<br>
				You shake at the pumping of the drums<br>
				The fists, the heels<br>
				Stringy calves that pound the desirous earth</p>
			</div>
			<div class="middle-column">				
				<p>I heard, crooned in a litany<br>
				That love is lord of all<br>
				A cunning messenger, cloaked sojourner<br>
				Fleet of foot through the reeds<br>
				Love, lord of all<br>
				What inconstant saint<br>
				Do we revel in</p>

	<h3>Grocery</h3>
		<p>Looking at the bark of the tree<br>
		Its grooves<br>
		Rough lines and edges<br>
		I feel alien</p>

		<p>When I go to the grocery<br>
		Among the produce aisle<br>
		Hollow voices echo over the loudspeaker<br>
		And I imagine the grocery<br>
		Its high, corrugated ceilings<br>
		Empty in the wake of human extinction<br>
		I imagine the rotting vegetables<br>
		The stacks of boxes in unnatural order<br>
		How long the preservatives will last</p>

		<p>I want to break the glass I am drinking from<br>
		I want to throw it against a brick wall<br>
		I want all of my teeth to fall from my mouth<br>
		Into my hands<br>
		Like spitting out fruit seeds<br>
		I want to stand among the pieces</p>

	<h3>Labyrinthine, Valentine</h3> 

		<p>This is a<br>
		Labyrinthine<br>
		Valentine</p>

		<p>Dry red sediment<br>
		And sand grained socks<br>
		Our feet forget their flesh<br>
		Horned goats in the path<br>
		Their bells are chiming metal goitres<br>
		Clamouring where we walk, trip, stop</p>

		<p>Us, amongst harmless minotaurs<br>
		Us, silent in the sun<br>
		Mouths parched<br>
		Minds deserted</p>

		<p>A dark haired tangle of a woman<br>
		With a devilâ€™s smile in her eyes<br>
		Twists and scrambles<br>
		Her thin arms and knobby joints<br>
		Intrepid on the mountainside</p>

		<p>She is a<br>
		Labyrinthine<br>
		Valentine</p>

	<h3>Annie, Cooking</h3>
			
<p>Your fingers, small, deft, brown;<br>
    A collection of animated lines and circles,<br>
Peel the casing from the chorizo,<br>
       Aromatic and oily,</p>

<p>As you speak to me of recipes,<br>
    Your accent, polite and undulating,<br>
	Recounts the delight of preparation.</p>

<p>Selecting the desired flavours<br>
    From lavish bounty<br>
	In all its vibrancy, its decay<br>
       Its dirt, its nourishment.</p>

<p>You run your supple fingers<br>
   Over a chiffon leaf of chard<br>
	Feeling every tear, every photosynthetic carbuncle.</p>

<p>You peel kale from its stem<br>
    With a purpose that captivates the surrounding space,<br>
That fills those who watch you with satisfaction<br>
       Before they have tasted the meal.</p>

<p>Zesting the lemon,<br>
I taste our conversation.</p>

<div>
	<h3>Howth Cliffs</h3>
		<p>White, paper-thin birds circle<br> 
		Stark green-dusted rock.</p>

		<p>Was I carved from alabaster<br>
		Birds dancing around my head?</p>

		<p>Harp strings, wordless wings<br>
		Minstrel stoic stone sings.</p>
