		<h3> Saint Patrick/Damballah </h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="column">
				<p> You once stood on the mantle<br>
				Perfumed by the bitter chocolate of peat<br>
				Master of a low-lying house<br><br>
				Your frame set against deltas cast in stone<br>
				Wooden beads, wooden beams<br><br>
				Your chipped paint eyes keen<br>
				Caught every hem curling around the door<br>
				The curve of a plucking hand<br><br>
				Your cheeks flushed in the vigour of it all<br>
				The rutting of the floorboards<br>
				Their creaks and withers<br>
				Giving to the intimacy of naked feet<br>
				Recoiling at the drop of a bottle<br><br>
				Your image distorted in the shattered glass </p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p>Now, behold yourself<br>
				Peppered with acrid spice<br>
				Warped by heat and water<br><br>
				Having lured the New World<br>
				Teeming with wild spirits<br><br>
				You do not delight in evil<br>
				Evil is not the painted mask of death<br>
				Nor the convulsing white-eyed priest<br><br>
				You who banished the serpents<br>
				Have but coaxed them out again<br>
				To coil in your untamed beard<br>
				And against your leathery skin<br>
				You shake at the pumping of the drums<br>
				The fists, the heels<br>
				Stringy calves that pound the desirous earth</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">				
				<p>I heard, crooned in a litany<br>
				That love is lord of all<br>
				A cunning messenger, cloaked sojourner<br>
				Fleet of foot through the reeds<br>
				Love, lord of all<br>
				What inconstant saint<br>
				Do we revel in</p>

	<h3>Grocery</h3>
		<p>Looking at the bark of the tree<br>
		Its grooves<br>
		Rough lines and edges<br>
		I feel alien</p>

		<p>When I go to the grocery<br>
		Among the produce aisle<br>
		Hollow voices echo over the loudspeaker<br>
		And I imagine the grocery<br>
		Its high, corrugated ceilings<br>
		Empty in the wake of human extinction<br>
		I imagine the rotting vegetables<br>
		The stacks of boxes in unnatural order<br>
		How long the preservatives will last</p>

		<p>I want to break the glass I am drinking from<br>
		I want to throw it against a brick wall<br>
		I want all of my teeth to fall from my mouth<br>
		Into my hands<br>
		Like spitting out fruit seeds<br>
		I want to stand among the pieces</p>

	<h3>Labyrinthine, Valentine</h3> 

		<p>This is a<br>
		Labyrinthine<br>
		Valentine</p>

		<p>Dry red sediment<br>
		And sand grained socks<br>
		Our feet forget their flesh<br>
		Horned goats in the path<br>
		Their bells are chiming metal goitres<br>
		Clamouring where we walk, trip, stop</p>

		<p>Us, amongst harmless minotaurs<br>
		Us, silent in the sun<br>
		Mouths parched<br>
		Minds deserted</p>

		<p>A dark haired tangle of a woman<br>
		With a devil’s smile in her eyes<br>
		Twists and scrambles<br>
		Her thin arms and knobby joints<br>
		Intrepid on the mountainside</p>

		<p>She is a<br>
		Labyrinthine<br>
		Valentine</p>

	<h3>Some strange story of creation, this love letter</h3>
			<p>In the beginning was the word and the word was my word, my body a black void in that expanse of everything.</p>

			<p>And the sea was all around, that dark everlasting presence, the potential for great destruction and great peace.</p>

			<p>Over that sea surface I saw my own face reflected and my face moved on that surface where every spirit had once drifted above and where they had also swum below for there had been no separation between the above or the below.</p>

			<p>And I asked for the morning and the midday and the gloaming. I beckoned that sweet pulsing light in the distance and it all gathered together as another half of darkness, as companion to that darkness. This gathered hue settled in the absence of what was once full of emptiness.</p>

			<p>The darkness, so open and vast and sure, dwelled there still alongside its other half, Day, who softened this darkness and made it last, for it now had a beginning and an end.</p>

			<p>These two sensations dwelt in the same breadth of existence, in a cyclical exchange. They occupied the same vessel but never at the same time, yet they could taste traces of each other upon the glass of the vessel.</p>

			<p>And I looked still at the darkness and I wanted more of its unknown and more of what could not be seen, so it was then cleft in two. One settled at the bottom and began to move and grew heavy while the other floated above.</p> 

			<p>Although the bottom grew heavy, I put my hand into its dancing clear space that appeared firm but I could not grasp for my hand lost its weight. I felt the sensation of what I thought it must feel to be the darkness above that was named Night.</p>

			<p>And all the below darkness converged together for it was filled with a deep, tugging longing, of which I do not know if it can be freed from.</p> 

			<p>This left a tangible, definite surface that had no transparent depth only a spreading texture. My body could stand upon this solid remainder, this great whole. It could support my weight so I could feel what I felt like as something with the capacity to hold and sustain and endure.</p>

			<p>Out of the piece of firm standing texture came spindly reaching lines of verdigris and peridot that stretched and spiralled outwards like my own arms. I felt a kinship with them in their desire to want more and to reach into what lies beyond.</p>

			<p>And the force that compelled these unravellings seemed to change pace and quickened.</p>

			<p>These green figures bore supple soft fruits that rested in my palm, they carried a sweet weight that my fingers could wrap around and mirror the shape. The fruits and my fingers were not giving nor taking but my fingers merely wanted to mimic the shape of the fruit for they sat suspended in that floating space so well, and perhaps I wished to do the same.</p>

			<p>The darkness still stood, divided in two parts.</p>

			<p>The Night and the Day desired for something to fill their spaces, so Day asked for the darker lines of Night to create for Day the outline of a sphere. This outline was Sun. The Night asked for Day to make a smaller outline for Night. This became Moon. Because Day could not make an empty space in the outline of Moon, Moon became changeable and fluid.</p>

			<p>So gently stratified in the darkness and the light were these two spheres, perched like birds.</p>

			<p>And what was once everything and nothing was still everything and nothing, there was just more movement.</p>

			<p>I beheld the teeming multitude, that contained the spirits of so many things that made so many sounds with voices that called and crooned and laughed and sang and screamed for fear and cried from sorrow, this entire cacophony of life that is chaos, that could not stop its noise, for the words to describe and name, to define and create, spiralled from such noises, and they added to the noise.<p>

			<p>There were noises unspoken and spoken, inside and outside, noises to be seen and heard because I could see the words when they were not there and hear them when they were.</p>

			<p>I asked this great many how can you be so good?</p>

			<p>And I found no answer, for all this life was so good.
			It was so good that even death was good.</p>

			<p>I asked, after seeing all this, I asked if I could keep some of it untouched, quiet, unspoilt, so that I could share what I had seen with those who I had seen it from, with those who brought it forth, with those who carried it with them.</p> 

			<p>And I was told no, for I as a vessel and as a noisemaker could not replicate, for I seemed to only be able to create more and more and never to repeat or preserve in pristine form and in this capacity I could only add to the many.</p>

			<p>I was to feel such fullness in life, but I was also unable to convey that I had seen it and that it was good in a manner that could be understood, and in this I see why babies cry.</p>

			<p>The ability to create that had been given to me was my one truth and it itself was not inherently true because it shifted and was a treacherous outpouring that came from me but that belonged to life and went into the things that were a part of life.</p>

			<p>I asked when will I end like the Day and the Night end? How will I leave a trace behind like the Day and the Night did so I can say to what comes after me: there were so many loves here that made me and I’d rather you remember them. See, here is how I saw them, and here is how beautiful they are and do you feel how much I have loved them and love them now and will continue to love them?</p>

			<p>And I received no answer concerning when I would end, only that even if I were to record all of my loves in the creation of something that praised them, that was born from a love of them, it would not last, just as I was not meant to last.</p>

			<p>Although I was there and I saw all that was created, I was not created to last and neither will my creations last and neither will all that I saw and all that I continue to see.</p>

			<p>I asked, why did the forces of creation instil such a love in me, a love that will last for my entire existence, if I cannot return a love that will last the creation’s entire existence?</p>

			<p>And there was no answer.</p>
